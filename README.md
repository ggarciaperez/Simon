# Simon
A class Project based inspired on Simon game
## Small description
* 4 color buttons for the game
* 3 buttons for functionality
* A debug/helper/info text panel
## 
Knows Issues:
* Game does not display system moves, only shows them as an array.
* Game does not detect player fails on the fly.
##
Stuff to do:
- [x] Migrate to MVVC
- [x] "Autoplay working"
- [ ] Rethink how to show system plays visually
